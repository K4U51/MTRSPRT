üîå 2. Assemble the Hardware

Wiring Overview:
	‚Ä¢	GPS Module:
	‚Ä¢	Connect GPS TX to ESP32 RX (e.g., GPIO16).
	‚Ä¢	Connect GPS RX to ESP32 TX (e.g., GPIO17).
	‚Ä¢	Power the GPS module with 3.3V and GND.
	‚Ä¢	OLED Display (SPI):
	‚Ä¢	Connect SCK to ESP32 SCK (e.g., GPIO18).
	‚Ä¢	Connect MOSI to ESP32 MOSI (e.g., GPIO23).
	‚Ä¢	Connect DC, CS, and RST to available GPIOs (e.g., GPIO27, GPIO5, GPIO33).
	‚Ä¢	Power the display with 3.3V and GND.
	‚Ä¢	MicroSD Card Breakout (SPI):
	‚Ä¢	Share SCK and MOSI lines with the OLED display.
	‚Ä¢	Connect CS to a separate GPIO (e.g., GPIO32).
	‚Ä¢	Power the SD card breakout with 3.3V and GND.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons:
	‚Ä¢	Connect one side of each button to a GPIO (e.g., GPIO12‚ÄìGPIO15).
	‚Ä¢	Connect the other side to GND.
	‚Ä¢	Use 10KŒ© pull-up resistors between each GPIO and 3.3V.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally, add 1KŒ© series resistors for debouncing.
	‚Ä¢	Power System:
	‚Ä¢	Connect the LiPo battery to the Feather‚Äôs JST connector.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally, wire the slide switch between the EN pin and GND for power control.

Assembly Tips:
	‚Ä¢	Use heat shrink tubing to insulate exposed wires.
	‚Ä¢	Secure components inside the 3D printed case using screws or adhesive.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all connections are solid to withstand vibrations during use.
